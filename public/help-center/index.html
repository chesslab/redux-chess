          <summary>What are heuristics in chess?</summary>
          <p>
            If you ask a chess pro why a chess move is good, they'll probably give you a bunch of reasons, many of them intuitive, about why they made that decision.
          </p>
          <p>
            Heuristics are quick, mental shortcuts that we humans use to make decisions and solve problems in our daily lives. While far from being perfect, heuristics are approximations that help manage cognitive load.
          </p>

          <summary>Can chess heuristics be shown while playing?</summary>
          <p>
            Yes, a simplified heuristics chart describing the current position can be shown to help better understand a position as opposed to the entire game.

          <summary>What is SAN?</summary>
          <p>
            SAN stands for Standard Algebraic Notation. It is a human-readable text format that allows chess players to read and write chess games in Portable Game Notation (PGN) format. A SAN movetext is basically the same thing as a RAV movetext with the only difference that it doesn't include variations.
          </p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>Can I load SAN games for further study?</summary>
          <p>
            The Internet contains a lot of information and ChesslaBlab comes with a free-to-use SAN reader.

        <details>
          <summary>What are annotated games?</summary>
          <p>
            Annotated games are games with comments that help understand what is going on the chessboard. They usually include variations showing the development of the game in selected positions that require an in-depth understanding.
