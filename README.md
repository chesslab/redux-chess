## React Chess

React Chess is "just a chessboard" as lightweight as it can possibly be. It is connected to this [chess server](https://github.com/chesslablab/chess-server) as well as to this [chess api](https://github.com/chesslablab/chess-api).

### Demo

Check out [this demo](https://www.chesslablab.com/).

### Install and Setup

Make sure that both the chess server and the API are set up properly as per the [`src/App.js`](https://github.com/chesslablab/react-chess/blob/master/src/App.js) file.
