## Redux Chess

React chessboard to be connected to a [PHP Chess server](https://github.com/programarivm/chess-server).

### Install

Via npm:

    $ npm i redux-chess

### Examples

Chessboard without server-side functionality. Check out this [demo](https://programarivm.github.io/demo-redux-chess).

```js
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import { Chess } from 'redux-chess';

const props = {};

ReactDOM.render(
  <Chess props={props} />,
  document.getElementById('redux-chess')
);
```

Chessboard with server-side functionality such as move validation and so on.

```js
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import { Chess } from 'redux-chess';

const props = {
  server: {
    host: '127.0.0.1',
    port: '8080'
  }
};

ReactDOM.render(
  <Chess props={props} />,
  document.getElementById('redux-chess')
);

```

It may appear as if being quite challenging provided it requires this [chess server](https://github.com/programarivm/chess-server) up and running. `redux-chess` is "just a chessboard" as lightweight as it can possibly be.

The chessboard just sends messages to a WebSocket server so make sure the chess server is running on localhost:

```
$ php cli/ws-server.php

/accept {"id":"id"} Accepts a friend request to play a game.

The post [How to Test a Local React NPM Package With Ease](https://javascript.plainenglish.io/testing-a-local-react-npm-package-with-ease-7d0668676ddb) might be helpful to get the `redux-chess` package up and running. Also it is recommended to test it from within [programarivm/testing-redux-chess](https://github.com/programarivm/testing-redux-chess) which is a host application for testing purposes.
